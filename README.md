## The problem DeCaritas solves
### THEME: Fintech
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- Issue: Lack of transparency in charitable donations breeds inefficiency and distrust.
- Problem: Traditional systems lack accountability, hindering donor ability to track contributions' impact.
- Consequence: Opacity undermines philanthropic effectiveness, erodes donor confidence, and limits charitable initiatives' impact.
## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
A blockchain-based donation traceability framework, de-caritas, is proposed to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients.

1. Platform: Built on Ethereum using Polygon Network for efficiency.
2. Architecture: Two key subsystems - transaction management and user authentication.
3. Components: Smart contracts for donations and transparency, decentralized database for records, consensus mechanism for block verification.
4. Parties involved: Donors, charitable organizations, and services.
## OBJECTIVES:
- Transparency: Every donation step recorded, enhancing donor confidence and ensuring transparency.
- Real-time Traceability: Blockchain records progress from donor to beneficiary, accessible to all involved parties.
- Trust and Accountability: Reinforces principles of transparency and accountability in philanthropy.
- Future Vision: de-caritas aims for a charitable landscape based on real-time traceability and trust, promising a brighter and more accountable future for charitable giving.
### Challenges we ran into
During the development of the project, one of the significant challenges encountered was the integration of blockchain with existing systems. Specifically, we faced obstacles in showcasing transactions conducted by campaign owners due to the lack of integration with blockchain in most systems. This posed a significant hurdle in achieving seamless transparency and traceability within the donation process.
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
