### THEME: Fintech
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- Issue: Lack of transparency in charitable donations breeds inefficiency and distrust.
- Problem: Traditional systems lack accountability, hindering donor ability to track contributions' impact.
- Consequence: Opacity undermines philanthropic effectiveness, erodes donor confidence, and limits charitable initiatives' impact.
  
## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Utilizing blockchain technology, we establish a platform for non profit organisations where the flow of funds is transparent and easily monitored. 
Donations received are deposited into a smart contract, and all transactions are securely recorded on a public distributed ledger. 
An organisation can create a campaign only if they provide valid Invoices and receipts as proofs and can collect the amount that is specified in the proof.
To ensure reliability, we offer a third-party verifier tasked with confirming the authenticity of the uploaded proofs.

## OBJECTIVES:
- Transparency: Every donation step recorded, enhancing donor confidence and ensuring transparency.
- Real-time Traceability: Blockchain records progress from donor to beneficiary, accessible to all involved parties.
- Trust and Accountability: Reinforces principles of transparency and accountability in philanthropy.
- Future Vision: de-caritas aims for a charitable landscape based on real-time traceability and trust, promising a brighter and more accountable future for charitable giving.
  
### Challenges we ran into
During the development of the project, one of the significant challenges encountered was the integration of blockchain with frontend. We also faced obstacles in coming up with the role of verifier and how it can be handled.
